# DataInsights_Python
by Victoria Porter (ncnvcii)

Some personal exploration into data analysis and visualisation using Python 3.9

I source most of my data (so far) from Kaggle.com. The aims of this repository are to demonstrate knowledge of data analytics, to 
keep my Python coding skills sharp, and to share insights into datasets. Thanks for stopping by!
