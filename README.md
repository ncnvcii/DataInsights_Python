# DataInsights_Python
by ncnvcii
Some personal exploration into data analysis and visualisation using Python 3.9

I source most of my data (so far) from Kaggle.com. The aims of this repository are to demonstrate skill in data analytics, to 
keep my Python coding knowledge sharp, and to share insights into found datasets. Thanks for stopping by!
